#Kim Uno Plus

This is my take on the Kim Uno project.

Release to branch this project was granted via email:


There's no license for the KIM Uno, it is freeware/open source/whatever
you like to do with it. But thank you for checking, so - yes. Formally
confirmed: do whatever you want with it! If you make an extended version
(like an AIM?) I'll buy the kit for sure!

Kind regards,

Oscar.
